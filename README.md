## Design

## Shoes microservice

I craeted a BinVO model based off of the Bin model with only the pertinent information. Then, created a poller that will grab data from the wardrobe-api. I created RESTful APIs for creating, listing, showing detail and deleting shoe objects. Next I created React components to show everything in the UI and added buttons that linked to the API functionality I had created.


## Hats microservice

Explain your models and integration with the wardrobe
microservice, here.

I am going to try my best not to cry, and then use my past project as reference to roughly bash my head against this project.
